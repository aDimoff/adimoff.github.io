								<b>Research Interests:</b> Binary stars are the best laboratories to test current theories and make new discoveries. My interests include orbital dynamics, (heavy element) nucleosynthesis, stellar evolution, and everything in between! I also find galactic archeology and stellar populations very interesting.
